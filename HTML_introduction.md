# HTML Overview

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content on the web by using various elements and tags. Here are some key points about HTML:

## Basic Structure

- HTML documents are plain text files with `.html` or `.htm` extensions.
- An HTML document starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, followed by `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

## Tags and Elements

- Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., `<tagname>`.
- Most tags have an opening tag `<tagname>` and a closing tag `</tagname>`.
- Elements are the content enclosed by the tags, e.g., `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`.

## Head and Body

- The `<head>` section contains metadata, links to stylesheets, scripts, and the document's title.
- The `<body>` section contains the content that is visible on the web page, such as text, images, links, and other media.

## Common Tags

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Header tags for headings.
- `<p>`: Paragraph tag.
- `<a>`: Anchor tag for hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: Image tag.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Tags for unordered and ordered lists.
- `<div>`: Division tag for creating sections.
- `<span>`: Inline container for text.

## Attributes

Tags can have attributes that provide additional information, e.g., `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>` (where `href` is an attribute of the `<a>` tag).

## Forms

HTML includes elements for creating forms for user input, such as `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, and others.

## Media

HTML supports embedding multimedia content, such as images (`<img>`), videos (`<video>`), and audio (`<audio>`).

## Semantics

Modern HTML includes semantic tags that provide more meaningful structures, such as `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>`.

HTML is fundamental to web development and works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to create complete, functional websites.
