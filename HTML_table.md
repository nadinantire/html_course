# HTML Tables

HTML tables are used to display data in a structured, tabular format. A table is defined using the `<table>` element, and it is composed of rows and columns. Each row is defined using the `<tr>` (table row) element, and each cell within a row is defined using either the `<td>` (table data) or `<th>` (table header) element.

## Basic Table Structure

The basic structure of an HTML table is as follows:

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
        <th>Header 3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
        <td>Data 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 4</td>
        <td>Data 5</td>
        <td>Data 6</td>
    </tr>
</table>
